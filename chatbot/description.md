# Artificial Intelligence based Chatbot for Customer Service
## Chatbot Application Report
***
`1. Overview:`
   This report describes a chatbot application implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The chatbot interacts with users, responds to their queries, and can provide answers based on predefined FAQs.
***
`2. Libraries Used:`
   - tkinter: Tkinter is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. It's used to create the graphical interface of the chatbot application, including windows, buttons, and text entry fields.
   - random: The random module is used to generate random responses from a list of predefined options when the chatbot encounters queries that don't match any loaded FAQs.
   - filedialog: Part of the tkinter library, the filedialog module is utilized to open file dialogs, allowing users to select and load FAQs from a text file.
***
`3. Functionality:`
   - The chatbot application provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the chatbot.
   - Users can input queries via a text entry field and send them to the chatbot by pressing the "Send" button.
   - The chatbot responds to user queries based on two sources of information: predefined responses and loaded FAQs.
   - Predefined responses are randomly selected from a list when user queries do not match any loaded FAQs.
   - Users have the option to load FAQs from a text file, with each FAQ formatted as "question: answer".
   - When a user inputs a query that matches a loaded FAQ, the chatbot responds with the corresponding answer.
   - The application provides a menu option to load FAQs from a text file, enhancing user convenience.
   - Loaded FAQs and user interactions are displayed in the chat history panel of the GUI, allowing users to track conversations.
***
`4. Code Structure:`
   - The main class of the chatbot application is `ChatbotApp`, which manages the GUI and functionality of the application.
   - GUI components such as windows, text entry fields, and buttons are created using tkinter widgets (`Tk`, `ScrolledText`, `Entry`, `Button`).
   - The `load_faqs` method allows users to load FAQs from a text file and stores them in a dictionary for easy access.
   - User interactions are handled by the `send_message` method, which processes user input, generates responses, and updates the chat history.
   - Additionally, the `generate_report` method generates a text report summarizing the loaded FAQs and sample interactions for documentation purposes.
***
`5. Algorithms:`
   - Random selection: The chatbot employs a simple random selection algorithm to choose responses from a predefined list when user queries do not match loaded FAQs. This algorithm ensures variety and spontaneity in the chatbot's responses.
***
`6. Future Improvements:`
   - Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP): Integration of more sophisticated NLP techniques such as sentiment analysis, intent recognition, and named entity recognition could enhance the chatbot's ability to understand and respond to user queries accurately.
   - External Data Integration: Integration with external APIs or databases could enable the chatbot to retrieve dynamic data in real-time, providing more diverse and up-to-date responses to user queries.
   - Enhanced GUI Features: Future improvements to the GUI could include features such as user authentication, chat history persistence across sessions, and support for multimedia content (e.g., images, videos) in the chat interface.
***
`7. Conclusion:`
The chatbot application provides a basic yet functional interface for users to interact with a chatbot and receive responses based on loaded FAQs. It demonstrates the use of GUI programming with tkinter for building interactive applications and basic text processing techniques for implementing conversational agents. While the current version offers a foundation for further development, future enhancements could enrich the chatbot's capabilities and user experience.
